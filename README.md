#GitHub README for BeerCellar
##Overview
BeerCellar is a web application that allows users to find bottles of beer through the [BreweryDB API](http://www.brewerydb.com) and then add those bottles to the user's "Cellar." By adding bottles to the cellar, users can keep track of bottles that they have acquired or bottles that they want to acquire. Even if the user doesn't add a bottle to the cellar, the search function can be used to find information on bottles of beer. Users should signup for full functionality of BeerCellar.
